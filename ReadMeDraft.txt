Project Description:
A centralized system which manages staff scheduling, patient appointments, patient records, and 
medical inventory.  Staff members such as doctors, nurses, admin, and patients are able to access 
the system based on their clearance to view, edit, or add information. 


Problem:
The hospital's current system for managing data across different branched is inefficient due to
the decentralized nature of the system.
- For doctors, accessing patient records is tedious.
- For administrators, staff scheduling and ordering inventory is a drag.
- For nurses, etc.
- For patients, etc.


Current Solution:
Data across the hospital is distributed.  This leads to inefficiencies with patient records, 
staff scheduling, inventory management, and patient appointments since information must 
be shuffled between the different branches of the hospital. 


Proposed Solution:
A centralized system that manages the hospital's state data and allows for the accessing and
editing of said data by staff members with the correct clearance, improving user experience for 
doctors, nurses, admin, and patients.
