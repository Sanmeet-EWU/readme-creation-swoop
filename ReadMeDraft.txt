SwoopHealth


Project Description:
SwoopHealth is a centralized management system that manages scheduling for staff, patient appointments and records, and 
medical inventory. Users like doctors, nurses, admins, and patients can all access the system. Depending on the user's role, they will or will not be able to view, edit, or add information.


Problem:
The hospital's current system for managing data across different branches is inefficient due to
the decentralized nature of the system.
- For doctors, accessing patient records is tedious.
- For administrators, staff scheduling and ordering inventory is time-consuming.
- For nurses, the system features are limited making it hard to learn more about patients without having higher authority.
- For patients, the messy design of the system makes it difficult to review important information regarding their health.


Current Solution:
Data across the hospital is distributed.  This leads to inefficiencies with patient records, 
staff scheduling, inventory management, and patient appointments since information must 
be shuffled between the different branches of the hospital. 

Risks:
Many risks arise from the hospital's current solution, including:
- privacy breaches
- wrongly scheduled appointments
- patient information mix-ups
- incorrect staff scheduling

Proposed Solution:
A centralized system that manages the hospital's state data and allows for the accessing and
editing of said data by staff members with the correct clearance, improving user experience for 
doctors, nurses, admin, and patients.

Problems Solved:
The proposed solution will lower the risk of privacy breaches, make scheduling easier for employees and patients, and keep patient information safe and organized.
